Her talk was split into two parts, her ocean rowing adventure and her application for NASA.</p>\n<p>In the first part, she talked about the adversity she faced while stuck out at sea, and then related that to her NASA application. We were extremely fortunate to have been able to host such an incredible and driven individual, and she was certainly an inspiration to many of our members.</p>\n<p>With an emphasis on finding what makes you stand out from the crowd, she taught us that pursuing what mattered to you is most important, and that being the only one doing what you're doing isn't a bad thing at all.</p>\n<p>Thanks heaps Sarah, we look forward to having you back again!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-10-20","title":"Talk from Sarah Kessans","tags":["speech","guest"],"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.1588132635253054,"src":"/static/773799a30130ffbcb5c5a0d236bed539/649be/sarah.jpg","srcSet":"/static/773799a30130ffbcb5c5a0d236bed539/eaa10/sarah.jpg 480w,\n/static/773799a30130ffbcb5c5a0d236bed539/73ffe/sarah.jpg 960w,\n/static/773799a30130ffbcb5c5a0d236bed539/649be/sarah.jpg 1328w","srcWebp":"/static/773799a30130ffbcb5c5a0d236bed539/a0c40/sarah.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/773799a30130ffbcb5c5a0d236bed539/5bab9/sarah.webp 480w,\n/static/773799a30130ffbcb5c5a0d236bed539/28365/sarah.webp 960w,\n/static/773799a30130ffbcb5c5a0d236bed539/a0c40/sarah.webp 1328w","sizes":"(max-width: 1328px) 100vw, 1328px"},"resize":{"src":"/static/773799a30130ffbcb5c5a0d236bed539/d260a/sarah.jpg"}}},"picture1":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/75b92a71a8b2e9169660c72e2330a78a/77e5b/crowd.jpg","srcSet":"/static/75b92a71a8b2e9169660c72e2330a78a/3dd8a/crowd.jpg 480w,\n/static/75b92a71a8b2e9169660c72e2330a78a/ef220/crowd.jpg 960w,\n/static/75b92a71a8b2e9169660c72e2330a78a/77e5b/crowd.jpg 1920w,\n/static/75b92a71a8b2e9169660c72e2330a78a/5600c/crowd.jpg 2048w","srcWebp":"/static/75b92a71a8b2e9169660c72e2330a78a/290e9/crowd.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/75b92a71a8b2e9169660c72e2330a78a/09081/crowd.webp 480w,\n/static/75b92a71a8b2e9169660c72e2330a78a/9790f/crowd.webp 960w,\n/static/75b92a71a8b2e9169660c72e2330a78a/290e9/crowd.webp 1920w,\n/static/75b92a71a8b2e9169660c72e2330a78a/ab4a4/crowd.webp 2048w","sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"},"resize":{"src":"/static/75b92a71a8b2e9169660c72e2330a78a/d260a/crowd.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/talk-from-sarah-kessans","prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/space-week-art-in-space","title":"Space Week; Art in space?","author":"Amber Joseph","tags":["social","space-week"]}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/event2","title":"Committee Roles 2019","author":null,"tags":["Committee"]}}}}
