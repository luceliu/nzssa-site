As part of Space Week 2018, we decided it would be epic to have a movie night that brings people together from all over the space community.

And because we can, we thought we might as well have it outdoors on a massive movie screen, with the opportunity for people to bring their friends, blankets, and turn the whole movie into an event in itself.

The final movie, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was decided by public vote and we were thrilled to be able to celebrate a week of space with close friends and the NZSSA community.
