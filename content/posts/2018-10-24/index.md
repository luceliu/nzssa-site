CELEBRATING SPACE SUCCESS!

Vaishnavi Anand, second year student at Victoria University of Wellington studying a Bachelor of Biomedical Science, has won the 2018 ISO World Standards Day Competition with her innovative idea of using satellites to monitor greenhouse gases. This years theme was “International Standards and the Fourth Industrial Revolution”, which refers to the new technologies that are transforming how society makes and does things.

Vaishnavi first had to win the National Round and then go on to represent New Zealand on the global stage. We are incredibly proud of her achievement and count ourselves lucky to have her as one of the main drivers behind the NZSSA.

We can’t wait to see her idea put into action!
