For Space Week 2018, we celebrated with a number of events; an outdoor movie screening of Guardians of the Galaxy; a space themed art competition, with a $100 Gordon Harris Voucher for first prize, $50 for second, and $25 for third; and 
a quiz night at Hunter Lounge, with $100 Bar Tab for the winning team, $50 for second, and $25 for third. 

We took this whole week as an opportunity for people from all over Wellington to connect and share a passion for space, regardless of their field of expertise. 
By including the art competition, we hope to jump start some more events next year that show how design expertise in Product Design, Architecture, Contextual Design, and Creative Technologies, all
have a very real and need role in space. It was a great week, with plenty of new friendships made and a growing of the NZSSA community.
