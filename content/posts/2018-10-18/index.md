On Monday 21st May we held the inaugural Students in Space conference. It was a great success, with attendees of all ages bursting with questions, space quizzes, planetarium shows, and most of all, some incredible entertaining speakers, from a range of fields within the space industry. Check out some photos from the night - we can't wait to see you at the next one!

We were incredibly lucky to have Rocket Lab's avionics manager Naomi Altman speak to us about her journey and what Rocket Lab is all about
Dr Stephen Curran from Victoria University taught us all about analysing star-forming hydrogen in the universe 
Dr Maria Pozza gave a very entertaining talk about the fascinating subject of space law
It was fantastic to have around 100 people come along to our very first conference, of what we hope to be many more to come
Congratulations to Celine for winning our Kahoot! One of the highlights of our intermission I'm sure.

Antony Gomez made us all feel very small - and yet significant - in his talk about the size of our universe 
Nick Agar took a philosophical approach to space travel, arguing that we need human storytellers - not just robotic probes - going out into space 
Our president Amber did a fantastic job of organising and hosting the conference - it's no small task! 
And finally, another NZSSA exec member Daniel wrapped up our conference with a summary of the present and future of space
