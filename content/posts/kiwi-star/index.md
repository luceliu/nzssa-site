A huge thank to KiwiStar Optics for showing us around and giving us an insight into what working in the space industry can entail right here in Wellington.

We met the amazing team from KiwiStar at the RASNZ Conference 2018 earlier this year in Christchurch, and were thrilled to be able to continue our chance meeting back in Wellington by inviting NZSSA members along for the trip to KiwiStar HQ's.

KiwiStar Optics create lenses for some of the world's biggest telescopes and proudly showed us their manufacturing process from the design to the machine manufacturing. 

It was a great opportunity for us to see some of the local companies that are the contributing to growing the global space industry. We could not be prouder!
