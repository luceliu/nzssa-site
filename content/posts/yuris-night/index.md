Tonight we celebrated global space achievement on Yuri's night; the night that a human first launched into space. 

Given this was our first event of the year, we decided to celebrate it in true university style. 
Daniel started the event with a presentation and kahoot on space and some of humanities greatest milestones in the space industry, before we got stuck into a lot of pizza and a screening of 2001 Space Odyssey which was...an experience to the least!


Nevertheless, it was a great first event for members to socialise and meet each other over a weird movie and good food.
