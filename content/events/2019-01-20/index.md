A plant biologist and biochemist by training and an adventurer thriving on challenges by nature, Sarah decided to throw her name in the hat for NASA's 2017 Astronaut Candidate selection cycle. The journey through the selection process to becoming one of the top 50 Finalist Interviewees (out of 18,000+ applications) revealed many lessons that can be applied to New Zealand's emerging space ecosystem. Come along to be inspired with tales of adventure and learn more about how UC and the greater community are working together to transform Christchurch into a hub for space research and industry.
