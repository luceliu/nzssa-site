{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>On Saturday 14th July 2018 the NZSSA held its first overnight stargazing trip at Camp Wainui. Both NZSSA members and those who just wanted a trip out to see the stars were treated to a stellar night of pizza, planets, and a picture-perfect sky. The weather could hardly have cooperated any better, apart from being a few degrees warmer. A dark, virtually cloudless sky allowed us to clearly see the band of the Milky Way. Antony from the Wellington Astronomical Society guided us around the sky, showing us star clusters and four planets of our solar system through his telescope. Viewing Mars was particularly fitting, given we also watched the movie The Martian during the night! Be sure to follow the NZSSA for opportunities to come on trips like this.
